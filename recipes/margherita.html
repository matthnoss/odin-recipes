    <p id="margherita-paragraph">This recipe makes a delicious pizza. It takes some time and effort but well worth it.
        I followed as directed and had excellent results. My first time baking a pizza on a stone, 
        will not make one any other way now. I made only 1 pizza, wrapped remaining 3 balls
        with plastic wrap and put in fridge. Next day removed one, let come to room temp
        and punched back down. Made pizza, came out as perfect as the first. The whole family
        loved this pizza. Thank you for the recipe.</p>
